	<p>On the Airbnb home page, enter your destination in the search box and then choose Experiences:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click <b>Dates</b> and enter your date (if you don’t know your date or it’s flexible, you can do this later).</li>
		<li>Click <b>Guests</b> and enter the number of guests.</li>
		<li>When you find the experience that you want to book, you can message the host to learn if they can host your group privately or customize the experience for your group.</li>
	</ol>
	<h1><b>Contact your Host or guest</b></h1>
